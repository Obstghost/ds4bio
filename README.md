# ds4bio_final project

Data Science for Biologists UML Fall 2023

**Purpose**

In this project we will be exploring a dataset from the study: *Age-specific impacts of vegetation functional traits on gastrointestinal nematode parasite burdens in a large herbivore*. The main goal of this research paper was to determine if the vegetation functional traits within an individual's home range were predicative of variation in GIN burdens and whether associations are age dependent. The data can be downloaded from a link in the paper.
